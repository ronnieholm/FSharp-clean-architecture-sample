# TODO

- [ ] Make note of how CLI tools can be fsx scripts, skipping console argument parsing
- [ ] Add functions in Web for converting Application results to HTTP response codes
- [ ] Begin transaction once per request and commit once per request
- [ ] Create console app to initialize database, including migrations (in web app with cmdline arg?)
- [ ] Link to C# and Go versions and red and blue books.
- [ ] Explore UMX library to add units of measure to every type to avoid memory overhead of wrapping basic types.
- [ ] Use System.Text.Json: System.Json.Text custom converter

- [ ] Re-implement Respawn features or use Docker to run each test in a container (see Nick's video)
      - Docker containers seem harder to manage in a CI/CD pipeline
