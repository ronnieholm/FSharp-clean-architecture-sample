# ADR006: Prefer API specification first over Swagger

Status: Accepted and active.

## Context

The application doesn't make use of the auto-generated Swagger (OpenAPI) web
interface. Instead API design first development using Stoplight Studio, while
adhering to Zalando REST API guidelines, is preferred.

## Decision

Handcrafting the OpenAPI specification allows for use of any part of the OpenAPI
specification. No need to fiddle with Swagger configuration or .NET attributes
and infering their relation to the generated specification.

It also doesn't polute ASP.NET controller and DTO types with an endless number
of attributes.

## Consequences

While the auto-generated Swagger interface is good for testing, it's easy to
accidentally change the specification. Crafting the specifiction with Stoplight
Studio (possibly code-generating server-side code from the spec) is more robust,
and not limited to what can be generated by attributes or workarounds.

Instead of going through the Swagger interface, the API specification can be
loaded into Postman which can then generate stub calls and verify that the
service complies with the specification.
